Breast Cancer Classification

Introduction
We have taken problem of classifying nature of breast cancer tumor.
The purpose of this project is to use deep learning methodology to predict nature of breast cancer tumor. 
This paper proposes design of Artiﬁcial Neural Network to tackle the chosen problem,moreover it also aims to compare
performance of various optimizers and loss functions  used in designing of Artiﬁcial Neural Network.
We proposed that model with Convolution   layers,   having   Drop - Out   and   Batch - Normalization,
with slow learning rate is best choice since it provide highest accuracy


Dataset Details
Dataset used is “Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset”, which is obtained from UCI machine learning repository.
It has 569 rows and 32 attribute features.
Features are captured from digitalized image of breast mass.
 
We need all these requirement in our system
