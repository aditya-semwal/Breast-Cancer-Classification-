# Breast-Cancer-Classification-
We compared results of combinations produced by various optimizer and loss functions for calssifying breast cancer and after depp studying added convolution layers with best seen combination as part of further research to improve the accuracy and suprisingly produced better results than original paper.
To see the results just run the main_code.ipynb in google collab.
No need to worry about data set as we have used already present data set in the library.
